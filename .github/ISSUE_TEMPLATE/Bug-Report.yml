        Thanks for taking the time to fill out this bug report! Most issues are documented in the [Snipe-IT repository's issues](https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/issues) or in the official [Common Issues section of the Documentation](https://snipe-it.readme.io/docs/common-issues#/) and are due to the following:
        
        - `.env` misconfiguration
        - [Server Permissions](https://snipe-it.readme.io/docs/debugging-permissions#/)
        - [Database Migrations](https://snipe-it.readme.io/docs/database-issues#run-migrations)
