/***********************************************
 * TODOS:
 *
 * First off, we should probably make it so that the main LDAP thing we're using is an *instance* of this class,
 * rather than the static methods we use here. We should probably load up that class with its settings, so we
 * don't have to explicitly refer to them so often.
 *
 * Then, we should probably look at embedding some of the logic we use elsewhere into here - the various methods
 * should either return a User or false, or other things like that. Don't make the consumers of this class reach
 * into its guts. While that conflates this model with the User model, I think having the appropriate logic for
 * turning LDAP people into Users ought to belong here, so it's easier on the consumer of this class.
 *
 * We're probably going to have to eventually make it so that Snipe-IT users can define multiple LDAP servers,
 * and having this as a more instance-oriented class will be a step in the right direction.
